# A typescript / javascript comparison 
Outlining the benefits of typescript and how it improves developer experience
and makes it easy to catch bugs

- In ts you can catch errors in development
- In js bugs might not be detected till runtime or might even be able to pass silently  



## SETUP
- Ensure you have a js runtime (E.g. Node.js or Bun )
- Ensure you have the typescript compiler `tsc`. if you haven't you can run:
```sh
npm i -g typescript
```


## RUN the typescript code using
```sh
npm run ts
```

## RUN the javascript code using
```sh
npm run js
```
